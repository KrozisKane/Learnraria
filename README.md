# Learnraria
Hello everyone, I am Krozis Kane and I currently learn C++. As my practice I chose to create a small game using SFML library. This game will be a tile-based game, which appearance and game mechanics will be like in the Terraria game.  
I chose Terraria because it's one of my favorite games. It is interesting for me to understand how its varied mechanics are implemented and try to reproduce it in C++.  
I also assume that there are people who share my interest. This is why I have made the code open source and distributed under the GNU General Public License v3.0, so that anyone interested can freely use my work in their own projects.
